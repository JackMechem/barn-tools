# jackshed — project notes for AI agents

This file is for picking up work on this repo in a fresh session (including on a different
computer after a clone). It's hand-maintained, separate from the auto-generated Next.js warning
in `AGENTS.md`.

## What this is

A personal collection of browser-based music practice tools, built for Jack (a musician/dev) as a
Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind app, all client components (`"use client"`). Everything runs
client-side — no backend, no accounts. Per-tool settings and data (tunes, projects, recordings)
persist in the browser via localStorage / IndexedDB, not on a server.

- **Displayed name:** "jackshed" (all lowercase, shown as the sidebar logo text and page title).
  It's been renamed several times in development (Barn Tools → Woodshed → The Barn → Barn Tools →
  shed.io → jshed.io → jackshed) — if asked to rename again, it's a simple find/replace across
  `app/layout.tsx`, `components/Sidebar.tsx`, `components/Home.tsx`, `app/recorder/page.tsx`.
- **GitHub remote:** `git@github.com:JackMechem/jackshed.com.git` (also renamed a few times;
  the home page's GitHub link in `components/Home.tsx` should match whatever it currently is).
- Jack drives development one request at a time and reviews by screenshot, so expect iterative,
  pixel-level follow-ups rather than big up-front specs. He's comfortable with technical detail in
  replies but the built-in style here favors plain, concrete explanations over jargon.

## Tools (sidebar order)

- **Jam Practice** (`components/JamPractice.tsx`) — random tune/tempo/key picker with a
  count-off metronome. Can draw from your own tune list or a built-in library of ~630 jazz
  standards (`lib/standards.ts`).
- **Metronome** — configurable time signature (including odd/custom meters), subdivisions,
  per-beat accents, tap tempo.
- **Polyrhythm Metric Modulation Metronome** (`components/RandomMetricModulation.tsx`) — same click engine
  and meter controls as Metronome, but every N bars it randomly jumps the tempo by a musical
  ratio (3:2, 4:3, 2:1, etc. — `lib/metricModulation.ts`), bouncing to the ratio's inverse if
  that would push the tempo out of range. Configurable bars-per-modulation (or "play until tempos
  realign" — each `Modulation` carries an exact `num`/`den`, so e.g. a 3:2 jump auto-sets the
  interval to 3 bars, the point where the new and reference tempos next share a downbeat), which
  ratios are in the mix, whether to avoid repeating the same one twice, and an optional "return to
  original tempo" mode that alternates modulate-away/return-home instead of drifting freely. Shows the
  upcoming tempo ahead of time and logs each modulation for the run in a `ToolLayout` `sidePanel`
  (see below). An optional second click (own tone, own mute, own `BeatIndicator`) runs the whole
  time as a second track on the _same_ `startClickEngine` call (see below) so it can hear/see it
  against whatever the main click has modulated to — pinned to the true starting tempo in "return
  to original" mode, or otherwise always the tempo the main click just left (one modulation
  behind). Each modulation carries an exact `num`/`den` (e.g. 3:2), so it also shows what the new
  tempo's quarter note is worth in the reference tempo's note values where that reduces to a
  single clean name (`describeQuarterEquivalence` in `lib/metricModulation.ts`; several ratios,
  like 4:3, genuinely don't and show nothing). The modulation itself is applied from inside
  `getSettings` (a param `startClickEngine` passes `(beat, sub)` into) rather than reacting to
  `onBeat`, so it lands exactly on the bar line instead of one beat late.
- **Tuner** — a Total-Energy-style circular note picker for a chromatic tuner + tone generator,
  with per-instrument string tunings.
- **Note Trainer** — drills random notes in an instrument's range. Has a mic-based "listen mode"
  (`lib/audioInput.ts`, `lib/pitchDetect.ts`, `lib/noteGrade.ts`) that listens through the
  microphone and grades correct/partial/incorrect, with a countdown ring and adjustable max-time
  per note. Once a note is graded, the same ring (plus a "Next note in Ns" readout,
  `components/CountdownLabel.tsx`) retargets to count down "Time between notes" instead (0–8s,
  a main Listen-mode control, not tucked in Advanced); an optional "Sound feedback" toggle adds a
  click each second of that countdown plus one the instant a note is graded, via
  `lib/clickEngine.ts`'s `scheduleClick`. Same mechanism as Scale Trainer's (see below), ported
  over afterward — `lockInResult` here is the equivalent of Scale Trainer's `lockInRound`.
  A lifetime "Struggles" side panel (`lib/struggleStats.ts`, shared with Scale Trainer — see
  below) tracks correct/partial/incorrect per note across every listen-mode session ever run
  (not reset between sessions, unlike the timed "History" list next to it), ranks them worst
  first, and a "Shed weak notes" button starts a focused session on just those — reuses the same
  queue machinery as "Drill every note" (`start()` takes a `StartRequest` —
  `{kind:"normal"|"weak"}` or `{kind:"string", stringIndex}`, all three driving the same
  `drilling`-gated code paths in `start()`/`advance()`) but sources its queue from
  `weakNotesInRange` instead of the whole range, forces listen mode on, and never writes to the
  timed History (a short focused run isn't a fair comparison against a full one). For a stringed
  instrument (`Instrument.strings` in `lib/instruments.ts` — bass4/5, guitar, ukulele, violin,
  viola, cello; mirrors the standard tuning already in `lib/tunings.ts` for the Tuner, which uses
  a separate instrument-id namespace and isn't reused directly) there's also a "Shed a string"
  button per string, same focused-session machinery again, queued from that string's own open
  note up to two octaves above it (clamped to the instrument's declared range — no fret-count
  data exists anywhere in the app, so this is a stated, adjustable assumption, not measured) —
  always shown and graded with the octave via `effectiveIgnoreOctave`, regardless of the "Ignore
  octave" toggle, since isolating one string is inherently octave-specific. That override is
  computed from `lastRequest` (which mode last ran) rather than `running`, so it also still
  applies to the results screen shown right after — but `start()` never reads it or the
  `ignoreOctave`-derived `rangeInput` directly for a string session (both are only current as of
  the last *completed* render, and `start()` needs values that are correct at the moment it's
  called, mid-render-cycle) — it recomputes both locally from the instrument's own declared range.
- **Scale Trainer** (`components/ScaleTrainer.tsx`, `lib/scales.ts`) — same shape as Note Trainer
  (shares its countdown ring, elapsed timer, advanced-slider, and note-spelling code — see shared
  conventions below), but drills scales instead of single notes: a random starting note plus a
  random mode from a selectable pool (`lib/scales.ts`'s `SCALE_MODES`, grouped into categories —
  the 7 major-scale modes, harmonic/melodic/harmonic-major, pentatonic/blues, the 7 melodic-minor
  modes, and the symmetric scales — with a sensible starter subset enabled by default). Listen
  mode expects the scale's notes in order, root to root; a wrong note fails the round (turns red)
  immediately by default. An optional "Partial credit" toggle (Listen mode → Advanced) instead
  gives each scale degree one retry — a second miss on the same degree still fails the round, but
  a degree that's missed once and then fixed lets the round finish as "partial" (amber) rather
  than "correct" (green), matching Note Trainer's correct/partial/incorrect grading
  (`GRADE_COLOR`/`GRADE_LABEL`/`Grade`/`scoreOf` now live in `lib/noteGrade.ts`, shared by both).
  The current round's note pills show progress live (matched/current-waiting-on-a-retry/failed)
  while it's running.
  "Drill every scale" plays every selected mode in all 12 keys (each with its own random octave)
  instead of a fixed count; a missed round is requeued with a freshly re-rolled octave rather than
  the identical one, so a repeated miss doesn't look like the same exact round stuck on screen. An
  "Ignore octave" toggle drops the octave number from every note shown (e.g. "C Dorian" instead of
  "C4 Dorian") **and** accepts the scale played in any octave — it's passed through to
  `gradePitch`'s own `ignoreOctave` option, not just a display flag. Once a round is graded, the
  same countdown ring (and a "Next scale in Ns" readout, `components/CountdownLabel.tsx`) retargets
  from "time left to play" to "time until the next scale", timed by the "Time between scales"
  slider (0–8s, promoted out of Advanced since it's a main control now); an optional "Sound
  feedback" toggle adds a click on every second of that countdown plus one the instant a scale is
  graded, via `lib/clickEngine.ts`'s `scheduleClick` (the same oscillator-click code the
  metronomes use) rather than a pitched note. Shares Note Trainer's lifetime "Struggles" panel
  (`lib/struggleStats.ts`) and "Shed weak scales" button, keyed by key *and* mode together (e.g.
  "F# Dorian" and "C Dorian" are tracked and shed separately, not lumped into one "Dorian"
  struggle) — the stat key folds a bare 0–11 pitch class and the mode id into one string
  (`scaleStatKey`/`parseScaleStatKey`), pitch class rather than a spelled letter so it survives an
  accidental-style change and doesn't care what octave it was played in. A weak session is one
  round per struggling key, built with `scaleRoundForPitchClass` for that exact key+mode rather
  than a random root of the mode — not the full `drillQueueForPool` 12-key-per-mode sweep "Drill
  every scale" does, so it stays quick and targeted on what's actually giving trouble.
- **Chord Charts** (`components/ChordCharts.tsx`, `components/ChordChart.tsx`,
  `lib/iRealPro.ts`) — paste an iReal Pro playlist link (the `irealb://...` links shared on the
  iReal Pro forums) and read its charts, styled to match the site. The link's chord data is
  scrambled/compressed in an undocumented way; `ireal-reader` (npm, MIT — the one non-audio
  runtime dependency in this repo) handles that part and splits the playlist into songs, but its
  own `measures` output _expands_ repeats/endings into one flattened, played-through list, which
  is right for playback but wrong for display. So `lib/iRealPro.ts` doesn't use that — it walks
  the same un-scrambled `raw` chart string itself (same token grammar: `*A` section letters,
  `{`/`}` repeat barlines, `N1`/`N2` endings, `<...>` directions like "D.C. al Coda", `XyQ` layout
  padding, a chord-token regex) to build a chart model that keeps the notation as written once,
  with repeat signs and ending brackets, instead of expanding it. Imported songs (title, composer,
  style, key, and the parsed bar list) persist in localStorage across playlists you paste in,
  de-duplicated by title/composer/key; "bars per row" is a display setting, not part of the parsed
  data. Verified by running the whole parser over a real ~1,460-song forum playlist (`node
--experimental-strip-types`, not committed) — no exceptions, no malformed chords, ~4.5MB of
  JSON for that whole playlist (comfortably under typical localStorage limits, but worth knowing
  if several large playlists get imported).
- **Slow Downer** — load a local audio/video file, slow playback without pitch shift, loop
  sections, add named markers with notes, zoom/pan the waveform.
- **Recorder** — multitrack recording: per-track clips, punch-in recording, trim/crop/repeat/move
  clips (even between tracks), automatic recording/playback sync via an inaudible burst-tone
  trick (`lib/syncBurst.ts`), a "align to beat" pitch-based nudge (`lib/alignBeat.ts`), WAV
  export/mixdown. **Desktop-only** — greyed out on phones via `desktopOnly` in
  `components/tools.tsx`'s `NAV_LINKS`.
- **Home** (`app/page.tsx` / `components/Home.tsx`) — just the logo/name and a "press / to
  search" hint; not itself in the nav list (the logo links to it instead).

## Shared conventions — reuse these before writing something new

- `components/ToolLayout.tsx`: the page shell every tool uses. `layout="split"` gives a
  hideable options column (the eye icon); `layout="stacked"` (Slow Downer, Recorder) is
  full-width with options in one card below. Takes `help={<HelpButton .../>}` for a controls
  dialog. The header icon next to the title is auto-picked from `NAV_LINKS` by matching the
  title string, so a new tool's title must exactly match its `NAV_LINKS` label. An optional
  `sidePanel` (+ `sidePanelLabel`) adds a second, independently hide/show-able column on the
  right (split layout only) — its own eye button, persisted via `useSidePanelHidden` in
  `lib/panels.ts` — for things like Note Trainer's time-history panel or the modulation log.
- `lib/meterControls.ts` + `components/MeterFields.tsx`: tempo/meter logic and UI shared by
  Metronome and Polyrhythm Metric Modulation Metronome — the log-scaled BPM slider,
  note-value-only beat unit,
  accent grouping, subdivision picker, tap tempo, and the `TempoHero`/`MeterOptions`/
  `SoundOptions` building blocks. Reuse these before adding another metronome-like tool.
- `lib/clickEngine.ts`'s `startClickEngine` takes an array of tracks (`{getSettings, onBeat}`
  each), all scheduled off one shared `setInterval` tick. Any tool playing more than one
  simultaneous click (like Polyrhythm Metric Modulation Metronome's reference click) should
  run them as tracks
  on the _same_ `startClickEngine` call, not as separate calls — two independent calls each get
  their own timer, and browser timer jitter can nudge one but not the other, so they slowly drift
  apart even though the underlying Web Audio scheduling of each is individually sample-accurate.
- `components/CollapsiblePanel.tsx` (split layout) / `components/OptionsCard.tsx` +
  `OptionSection` (stacked layout) for settings sections. `CollapsiblePanel` supports
  `toggle={{checked,onChange,disabled}}` to put a switch in the header that gates whether the
  section can expand.
  - **Hydration gotcha:** the chevron button in a gated `CollapsiblePanel` must always be
    _rendered_ (visually hidden with a CSS class like `invisible` when not expandable), never
    conditionally mounted/unmounted — the checked value comes from localStorage and can differ
    between the server default and the saved client value, and an element that's added/removed
    based on that will cause a real hydration mismatch. A class-only difference is fine.
  - **Option descriptions are opt-in, per section.** Both `CollapsiblePanel` and `OptionsCard`
    always show a "?" toggle in their header (next to the title, persisted alongside that
    section's open/closed state) and provide a `lib/hints.ts` `HintsContext` down to their
    children, off by default. `SwitchRow` and `AdvancedSlider` only show their own `hint` prop
    text while that context is on; description text that isn't already routed through one of
    those (e.g. a standalone explanatory paragraph, like several in Recorder's option panels)
    should use `components/Hint.tsx` directly instead of a bare `<p>`, so it's covered by the
    same toggle. Descriptions are never shown by default — always add them behind this
    mechanism, not as always-visible text. Every option across every tool now has one — treat
    "add a new setting" as also meaning "add its hint."
- `lib/usePersistedSettings.ts`: the localStorage-backed settings hook nearly every tool uses.
  **Always pass a module-level constant default object**, never an inline literal, or the
  `useSyncExternalStore` memoization (and SSR-safety) breaks.
- `components/Select.tsx`, `SwitchRow.tsx`, `ConfirmDialog.tsx`, `PromptDialog.tsx`,
  `NumberField.tsx`, `KeyHint.tsx`, `HelpButton.tsx`, `ContextMenu.tsx`: shared
  form/dialog/menu primitives.
- `components/Waveform.tsx` + `lib/multitrack.ts` (the `Engine` class) + `lib/clips.ts`: the
  audio-editing core shared by Slow Downer and Recorder — waveform drawing/interaction (zoom,
  pan, loop, markers, clip trim/repeat/move), and sample-accurate scheduled playback. Read before
  touching; it's the most complex part of the codebase.
- `components/tools.tsx`: every icon component plus `NAV_LINKS` (the sidebar/search/title-icon
  source of truth) and `TOOLS` (currently unused, `NAV_LINKS` minus `/`).
- `lib/noteSpelling.ts` (accidental spelling: sharp/flat/random/both), `lib/trainerUtils.ts`
  (`formatDuration`, `shuffled`), and `components/AdvancedSlider.tsx` /
  `CountdownRing.tsx` / `CountdownLabel.tsx` / `ElapsedTimer.tsx`: pulled out of Note Trainer when
  Scale Trainer was built, since both drill-style trainers need the same note-name spelling, timer
  readouts and countdown ring (`CountdownLabel` is `ElapsedTimer`'s mirror image — a ticking "Ns"
  readout counting down instead of up, both driven by the same rAF-write-to-DOM pattern so a
  fast-ticking display doesn't force a re-render). `lib/noteGrade.ts`'s `Grade` type also carries
  `GRADE_COLOR`/`GRADE_LABEL` (correct/partial/incorrect colors and labels) and `scoreOf`
  (correct = 1, partial = 0.5), for the same reason. `lib/struggleStats.ts` (`bumpGradeCounts`,
  `rankWeak`, `weaknessScore` = incorrect + partial×0.5) is the lifetime per-note/per-scale
  struggle tracking behind both trainers' "Struggles" panel — generic over the string key, so
  Note Trainer keys it by note and Scale Trainer by mode id. Reuse these before adding another
  drill/quiz-style tool.

## What's genuinely untested

Every change here has passed `next build` + `tsc --noEmit` + `eslint`, and audio-processing logic
(WAV encoding, pitch/beat detection, latency alignment) has been spot-checked with small synthetic
Node scripts — but **none of it has been exercised in a live browser with real audio hardware**.
If Jack reports odd behavior in any of these, treat it as genuinely unverified, not a regression
from something that used to work:

- Recorder: multitrack recording/overdub, the auto-latency burst-tone alignment, "align to beat",
  moving clips between tracks, WAV export/mixdown.
- Note Trainer listen mode: live pitch grading accuracy, the "ignore a held-over note" fix, the
  always-on max-time timer, and the "Sound feedback" click scheduling (a `setTimeout` per
  countdown second, cleared and rescheduled on every note change). "Shed a string" specifically:
  whether two octaves above the open string is actually the right span for a real instrument (no
  fret-count data exists to check against — see the shared-conventions note above) and whether
  the octave-override actually holds through to grading and the results screen as intended.
- Scale Trainer listen mode: same live-pitch-grading machinery as Note Trainer, plus its own
  untested bit — advancing through a scale's notes in sequence (settling between each one so a
  held note's tail isn't graded as an attempt at the next degree), failing the whole round on a
  wrong note (immediately by default, or after a second miss on the same degree with "Partial
  credit" on), the drill queue's per-key/per-octave coverage, and the "Sound feedback" click
  scheduling (a `setTimeout` per countdown second, cleared and rescheduled on every round change).
- Tuner: the tone generator and the per-instrument string tunings.
- Polyrhythm Metric Modulation Metronome: the bar-boundary detection driving each
  modulation (relies on the
  click engine's `onBeat` callback timing).
- Chord Charts' `FitChordRow` (`components/ChordChart.tsx`): keeps a bar's chords on one line by
  measuring the row's natural width against the bar's available width (`ResizeObserver` +
  `scrollWidth`/`clientWidth`) and applying `transform: scaleX()` to compress it exactly enough to
  fit, instead of wrapping or overflowing. This one's untested for a different reason than the
  audio items above — it's plain DOM layout, no special hardware — but this sandbox has no working
  browser to actually render in (Playwright's Chromium is missing OS shared libraries — e.g.
  `libnss3.so`, `libgtk` — and installing them needs `sudo`, which isn't available
  non-interactively here); `next build`/`tsc`/`eslint` are all it's been checked with.

## Environment quirk (may not apply on a different machine)

On the machine this was developed on, something outside of any explicit `git commit` call was
auto-committing file edits to `main` as Jack's own git identity — `git status` looked clean
mid-session even though a lot had just changed. If that's not the case on a fresh clone/machine,
don't assume it — check `git log`, but also remember to actually commit (and push, which needs
Jack's hardware security key and can't be done from a sandboxed/non-interactive session) when work
should be saved.
